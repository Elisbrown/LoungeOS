- Documentation & Support: Comprehensive user manual, detailed setup instructions for local server deployment, a troubleshooting guide/knowledge base, and readily available contact/support information.
- UI/UX Specifics: Predominantly black and white UI with small accents of red, blue, and green for emphasis; all buttons must have rounded corners and leverage Shadcn UI elements.
- Development Utilities: The application can start and function with mock data if the SQLite database is not connected or initialized.
- Session Management: Automatic session expiration after 2 hours of inactivity, prompting for re-authentication to stay logged in.
- Password Policies: Enforcement of strong password criteria (minimum length, character types) for new and reset passwords.
- Default Language: French is the default language, and the selected language preference is stored in the browser's local storage.

- Logging of Actions: Comprehensive logging of all staff account management actions (creation, modification, password reset, activation/deactivation, deletion) and all significant application actions (sales transactions, inventory adjustments, etc.) for auditing.
- Product Listing Details: Visual highlighting for products with low stock, support for defining product variations (e.g., "Small," "Medium," "Large"), and an option to link food items to constituent ingredients.
- Category Management Details: Managers can select icons from a pre-defined set for categories, default categories (`Food`, `Whiskey`, `Wine`, `Beer`, `Soft_drinks`) are pre-populated, and the system handles products assigned to deleted categories (e.g., reassign or prompt for reassignment).
